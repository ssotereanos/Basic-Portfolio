      	   		 I am a graphic designer who is in the process of becoming a full-stack developer. I have a passion to create and with code I feel like I am going to have the world at my fingertips. I am looking forward to what 6 months of coding bootcamp intails, and can't
      	   		 wait to see the skillset I have once I am finished. With a combination of hard work and timing, I am exicted to reach all my goalsof becoming the best web-developer I can be.
